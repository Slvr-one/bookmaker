# bookmaker_app:

This is a custom app I build from scratch in golang,
while self learning the inner working of this amaizing coding experience of a language.

This app was designed as a simple web server for some minimal bookmaking, aka gambling by defining several endpoints to handle HTTP requests.
The program defines several structs to represent data, including Horse, Record, Person, and Bet.
It allows investors to participate in various events.
The app is connected to a MongoDB database for persistancy between events.
Built with Go, utilizing MongoDB, Nginx, Docker & Compose.


## Breakdown:
This app is part of my Portfolio project, which includes
developing and implementing CI/CD workflows with Jenkins, github actions, argocd.
Observability, Logging & Monitoring with EFK, Prometheus & grafana.
Deployed & configured with Kubernetes, Helm, Ansible, Terraform.
While Implementing:
    Microservices Architecture
    Gitops
    Github Flow
    Modularity
    Automation
    
##  initializing a MongoDB client, connect to a MongoDB database, and insert multiple documents into a collection/table:

-- The initMongoDB function initializes a MongoDB client with the URL "mongodb://localhost:27017", connects to the MongoDB database named "bookmaker", 
-- creates a collection named "bets" in the "bookmaker" database,
-- inserts three documents into the "bets" collection using the InsertMany method.
-- Each document is a BSON document that consists of several fields, such as:
    "fullName", 
    "age", 
    "amount", 
    "profit". 

-- The bson.D type is used to represent a BSON document in Go code. 
-- After inserting the documents, the InsertedIDs field of the InsertManyResult object is printed to the console.

## REST API REF:

HTTP endpoints:

-- "/" - A welcome page that displays the number of horses available and the current date and time.
-- "/health" - A health check endpoint that returns a simple message to indicate that the server is up and running.
-- "/horses" - An endpoint that returns the number of horses available.
-- "/horses/{name}" - An endpoint that returns information about a specific horse by name.
-- "/horses/{name}/bet/{amount}" - An endpoint that allows the user to place a bet on a specific horse.
-- The program also defines several functions to handle these endpoints. The GetHorses function returns the number of horses available, the GetHorse function returns information about a specific horse, and the Invest function allows the user to place a bet on a specific horse. The main function initializes the web server and sets up the routing.


| Path | Method | Description |
| :-------- | :------- | :------- | 
| `/home` | `GET` | `home page`
| `/assets` | `GET` | `images & html` |
| `/health` | `GET` | `for health check` |
| `/metrics` | `GET` | `for monitoring purposes` |
| `/LH` | `GET` | `list all available horses` |
| `/GH/{name}` | `GET` | `list a specific horse detail` |
| `/UH/{name}` | `PUT` | `update a specific horse by name` |
| `/invest/{horse}/{amount}` | `UPDATE` | `invest - gamble on a horse` |
